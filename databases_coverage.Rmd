```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## To-do list

- [] Get all doi's from the databases analyzed
- [] Remove redundant items (due to a single document belonging to multiple fields) - Only needed because we had to split the data by field in order to recover all the documents.



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
